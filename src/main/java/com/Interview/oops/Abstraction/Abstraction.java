public class Abstraction {

    //Abstraction in Java is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it
    // involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system while exposing only the
    // essential features to the users. It allows focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.
    //
    //Abstraction in Java can be achieved through:
    //
    //Abstract classes: These are classes that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract
    // methods (methods without a body) and non-abstract methods (with implementation).

    //Interfaces: These are fully abstract classes, meaning all methods in an interface are abstract by
    // default (until Java 8 introduced default and static methods in interfaces).

    //Benefits of Abstraction:
    //Code simplicity: Users work with a simplified view of the system without worrying about the details.
    //Flexibility and maintainability: Changes to the underlying implementation can be made without affecting the code that uses it.
    //Security: By exposing only essential details, abstraction helps hide the sensitive implementation details.

    //Abstraction simplifies code maintenance, enhances security, and makes systems more flexible and extensible by
    // allowing changes in implementation without affecting the external interface.
