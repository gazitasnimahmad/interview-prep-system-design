package com.Interview.oops.polymorphism;

public class polymorphism {

    //It refers to the ability of object-oriented programming languages to differentiate between entities
    // with the same name efficiently.
    // This is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration of these entities.

    //Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading): Methods with the same name but different parameters
    // within the same class.
    //Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding): Methods in a superclass are overridden by a subclass to
    // provide specific implementation.

    //Summary of Benefits:
    //Code Reusability: Share common behavior and reduce duplication.
    //Flexibility and Maintainability: Easily extend and modify functionality.
    //Simplification: Handle different objects with common interfaces, reducing complexity.
    //Extensibility: New features can be added without affecting existing code.
    //Dynamic Behavior: Ensure correct method execution at runtime.
    //Loose Coupling: Interactions through abstractions promote modularity.
    //Improved Readability: Cleaner, more organized code structure.
