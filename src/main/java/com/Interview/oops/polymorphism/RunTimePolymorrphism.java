    // method to be executed is determined during the runtime, not at compile-time.
    // It is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation
    // of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

    //Key Features of Run-Time Polymorphism:
    //Method Overriding: It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is
    // already defined in its superclass.

    //Inheritance: Run-time polymorphism relies on inheritance and the subclass's ability to override
    // methods from the parent class.

    //Dynamic Binding: The method to be executed is determined during the programâ€™s execution based on
    // the object type (even if the reference is of the parent class).

    //Upcasting: In run-time polymorphism, the superclass reference variable can refer to an object of a
    // subclass, but at runtime, the subclass's method is executed.
