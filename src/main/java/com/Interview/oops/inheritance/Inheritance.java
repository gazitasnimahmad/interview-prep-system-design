public class Inheritance {

    // Inheritance in Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where one class (the child or subclass)
    // inherits the fields and methods of another class (the parent or superclass).
    // It enables code reusability, method overriding, and promotes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

    //Benefits of Inheritance:
    //Code Reusability: Common functionality is written once in the superclass and reused in subclasses.
    //Method Overriding: Subclasses can modify or extend the behavior of inherited methods.
    //Extensibility: You can easily add new subclasses with additional features without modifying existing code.
    //Maintainability: Reducing redundancy improves the maintainability of the code.
